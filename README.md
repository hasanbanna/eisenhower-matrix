# Eisenhower Decision Matrix

Eisenhower decision matrix (aka Covey matrix) is a method of prioritizing your tasks on the basis of their urgency/importance.

The purpose of this matrix is to generate an ordered list that can be further processed with your choice of todo application.

## Usage

```bash
git clone https://github.com/hasanbanna/eisenhower-matrix.git && cd eisenhower-matrix
npm run serve
```

Add a list of your tasks into the textarea and visually prioritise them using the matrix by dragging the points onto the four different quadrants which correspond to the four different priority groups and then use the buttons to copy the ordered tasks in plain text or in org format.
